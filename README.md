# Video-GAN
Implementation of "Stitching and Blending together Synthesized and Temporal layers using GAN" by Fabian Barreto SJ, Divij Pawar, Janhavi Patil, Prince Sah.

Visual effects is an exciting but daunting area for many. Advanced visual effects software already exists as a tool for many to create these videos, yet it still requires years of practice and skill to perfect the craft. Our project aims at bridging the gap between beginners and professionals by creating a blending tool to blend objects into a video automatically and seamlessly with the use of a blending GAN. We aim to adapt the already tested Gaussian Poisson GAN or [GP-GAN](https://github.com/wuhuikai/GP-GAN) to achieve a near realistic video result which can be comparable to a professional video. 

[GP-GAN](https://github.com/wuhuikai/GP-GAN) is a landscape feature blending GAN but we aim to adapt it for objects.
